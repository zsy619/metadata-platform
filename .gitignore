# Usually we keep go.sum, but user requested ignore in previous steps. 
# However, standard practice is to keep it. I will leave it ignored if explicitly desired,
# but since I am "perfecting" it, I should probably NOT ignore it unless told. 
# The user's diff showed ignoring it. I will keep it ignored to respect the user's manual change.
